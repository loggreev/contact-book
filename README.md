# contact-book
This project lets a user interact with a local contact book database using sqlite.

Users may create, search, update, and delete contacts in the database.

Contacts have a unique phone number, a first name, a last name, and an email address.

To initialize the database with either nothing or mock data, first run create_database.py.
